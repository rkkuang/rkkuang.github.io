- [Connecting optical morphology, environment, and HI mass fraction for low-redshift galaxies using deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00018)
  - A galaxy's morphological features encode details about its gas content, star formation history, and feedback processes which regulate its growth and evolution.
  - We also use a visualization algorithm, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM), to determine which morphological features are associated with low or high gas content. These results demonstrate that CNNs are powerful tools for understanding the connections between optical morphology and other properties, as well as for probing other latent variables, in a quantitative and interpretable manner.

- [High-resolution Spectra and Biosignatures of Earth-like Planets Transiting White Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00049)
  - **Interesting**
  - With the first observations of debris disks as well as proposed planets around white dwarfs, the question of how rocky planets around such stellar remnants can be characterized and probed for signs of life becomes tangible.
  - Why White dwarfs are intriguing targets for exoplanet searches and terrestrial planet atmospheric characterization.
  - All high-resolution transmission spectra will be publicly available online upon publication of this study and can be used as a tool to prepare and interpret upcoming observations with JWST, the Extremely Large Telescopes as well as mission concepts like Origins, HabEx, and LUVOIR.

- [High resolution Spectra of Earth-Like Planets Orbiting Red Giant Host Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00050)
  - We model reflection and emission spectra of Earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zone of red giant hosts with surface temperatures between 5200 and 3900 K at the Earth-equivalent distance, as well as model planet spectra throughout the evolution of their hosts. We present a high-resolution spectral database of Earth-like planets orbiting in the red giant habitable zone from the visible to infrared, to assess the feasibility of characterizing atmospheric features including biosignatures for such planets with upcoming ground- and space-based telescopes such as the Extremely Large Telescopes and the James Webb Space Telescope.

- [Asymmetric Surface Brightness Structure of Lensed Arc in SDSS J1226+2152: A Case for Dark Matter Substructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00261)
  - **Relevant**
  - One explanation of unequal magnification is strongly coupled microlensing by intracluster stars, which induces independent flux variations in the images of individual or groups of source stars in the lensed galaxy.
  - For a second possibility, intracluster dark matter subhalos invisible to the telescope can effectively perturb lensing magnifications near the critical curve and give rise to persistently unequal image pairs.
  - The arc under our study is a scheduled target of a Director’s Discretionary Early Release Science program of the James Webb Space Telescope, which will provide deep images as well as a high-resolution view with integral field spectroscopy

- [Testing the Prediction of Fuzzy Dark Matter Theory in the Milky Way Center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00318)
  - The fuzzy dark matter model (FDM, also known as quantum wave dark matter model) argues that light bosons with a mass of ∼10−22eV are a possible candidate for dark matter in the Universe. One of the most important predictions of FDM is the formation of a soliton core instead of a density cusp at the center of galaxies.

- [Spectroscopic confirmation of a mature galaxy cluster at redshift two](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00549)
  - Galaxy clusters are the most massive virialized structures in the Universe and are formed through the gravitational accretion of matter over cosmic time. The discovery of an evolved galaxy cluster at redshift z=2, corresponding to a look-back time of 10.4 billion years, provides an opportunity to study its properties.

- [Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational-Wave Search and Deep Learning Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00279)
  - We describe a search and classification procedure for gravitational waves emitted by core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with an event trigger generator known as Wavelet Detection Filter (WDF).
  - To test the accuracies of our 1-D and 2-D CNN classification, we add CCSN waveforms from the most recent hydrodynamical simulations of neutrino-driven core-collapse to simulated Gaussian colored noise with the Virgo interferometer and the planned Einstein Telescope sensitivity curve. We find classification accuracies, for a single detector, of over 95% for both 1-D and 2-D CNN pipelines. For the first time in machine learning CCSN studies, we add short duration detector noise transients to our data to test the robustness of our method against false alarms created by detector noise artifacts. Further to this, we show that the CNN can distinguish between different types of CCSN waveform models.

- [The Inspiring Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00456)
  - **Interesting**
  - A book, Visser, J., & Visser, M. (Eds.). (2020). Seeking Understanding, Brill | Sense, Pages: 119--135
  - Universe Awareness (UNAWE) uses the beauty and grandeur of the Universe to encourage young children, particularly those from an underprivileged background, to have an interest in science and technology and foster their sense of global citizenship from the earliest age.

- [An accurate strong lensing model of the Abell 2163 core](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08117)
  - **Relevant**
  - Abell 2163 at *z*≃0.201 is one of the most massive galaxy clusters known, very likely in a post-merging phase. Data from several observational windows suggest a complex mass structure with interacting subsystems, which makes the reconstruction of a realistic merging scenario very difficult. A missing key element in this sense is unveiling the cluster mass distribution at high resolution. We perform such a reconstruction of the cluster inner total mass through a strong lensing model based on new spectroscopic redshift measurements. We use data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to confirm 12 multiple images of 4 sources with redshift values from 1.16 to 2.72. We also discover four new multiple images and identify 29 cluster members and 35 foreground and background sources. The resulting galaxy member and image catalogs are used to build five cluster total mass models. The fiducial model consists of 111 small-scale subhalos plus a diffuse component, which is centered ∼2 arcseconds away from the BCG belonging to the east Abell 2163 subcluster. We confirm that the latter is well represented by a single, large-scale mass component. Its strong elongation towards a second (west) subcluster confirms the existence of a preferential axis, corresponding to the merging direction. From the fiducial model, we extrapolate the cumulative projected total mass profile and measure a value of *M*(<300kpc)=1.43+0.07−0.06×1014M⊙, which has a significantly reduced statistical error compared with previous estimates, thanks to the inclusion of the spectroscopic redshifts. Our strong lensing results are very accurate: the model-predicted positions of the multiple images are, on average, only 0.15 arcseconds away from the observed ones.

- [A Microlensing Accretion Disk Size Measurement in the Lensed Quasar WFI 2026-4536](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06218)
  - **Relevant**
  - examine microlensing variability in the quadruply-imaged lensed quasar WFI 2026-4536.
  - This size measurement is fully consistent with the Quasar Accretion Disk Size - Black Hole Mass relation, providing another system in which the accretion disk is larger than predicted by thin disk theory.

- [The Gravitational Wave Treasure Map: A Tool to Coordinate, Visualize, and Assess the Electromagnetic Follow-Up of Gravitational Wave Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00588)

- [Clusters of Galaxies: Structure and Dynamics in the Last 8 Gyr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00800)
  - Clusters of galaxies, being dark matter dominated, have long been and still are the ideal cosmological targets to study the nature of dark matter. Constraints on the nature of dark matter comes in particular from the observational determination of the distribution of total and baryonic mass in clusters, by comparison with results from cosmological numerical simulations. I present here past and recent results on this research topic.
- [Resolving the Nuclear Radio Emission from M32 with Very Large Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00827)
  - The Local Group dwarf elliptical galaxy M32 hosts one of the nearest and most under-luminous super-massive black holes (SMBHs) ever known, offering a rare opportunity to study the physics of accreting SMBHs at the most quiescent state.
  - Very Large Array (VLA) observations have detected a radio source at the nucleus of M32, which is suggested to be the radio counterpart of the SMBH.

- [HIR4: cosmology from a simulated neutral hydrogen full sky using Horizon Run 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00833)
  - we simulate future surveys of neutral hydrogen using the Horizon Run 4 (HR4) cosmological N-body simulation. We generate HI intensity maps from the HR4 halo catalogue, and combine with foreground radio emission maps from the Global Sky Model, to create accurate simulations over the entire sky.
  - We test the accuracy of the fastICA, PCA and log-polynomial fitting foreground removal methods to recover the input cosmological angular power spectrum and measure the parameters.

- [There's No Place Like Home (in Our Own Solar System): Searching for ET Near White Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00673)
  - **Interesting**
  - Any technologically advanced civilization residing within the habitable zone of a G-star will face grave peril when its star transitions from the main sequence and successively enters sub-giant, red giant, planetary nebula, and white dwarf stages.
  - In fact, if the civilization takes no action it will face certain extinction. The two alternatives to passive extinction are ...
  - This leads to the conclusion that sub-giants, red giants, planetary nebula, and white dwarfs are the best possible candidate targets for SETI observations.
