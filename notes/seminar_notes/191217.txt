 Title:	 How Black Holes Shed Light on Gravity and How Astronomers Might See It (special seminar)
 Speaker:	 Prof. Bartek Czech (IASTU)

ABSTRACT

Our understanding of all gravitational systems, including the universe, is profoundly affected by what we know (and don't know) about black holes. I will sketch two ways in which black hole physics sheds a distinct light on gravity. One is the "holographic principle," the surprising idea that the complete data about any gravitational system can be laid out on the surface of a screen surrounding the system, with finite entropy density. The second way is the black hole information paradox and its modern avatar--the firewall. I will try to sketch other people's work on potentially observable signatures of firewalls in gravitational wave astronomy.

BIO
Bartek Czech is a graduate of Harvard University (B.A. '02) and the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D. '09). He has lived and worked in seven countries on three continents, including the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and Stanford University. He is now a tenure-track member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Tsinghua University. In his research, Bartek applies concepts from quantum information theory, high energy physics and condensed matter theory to understand the microscopic structure of space and time. The background of this work is that a gravitational spacetime is a hologram and the glue that holds it together is quantum information. In his spare time, Bartek studies languages (he speaks five fluently) and climbs mountains.
