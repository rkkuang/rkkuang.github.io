 Title:	 Reverberation mapping of AGNs: roles in the interferometer era
 Speaker:	 Prof. Jianmin Wang (IHEP)
 Location:
蒙民伟科技南楼S727



ABSTRACT

It is the GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer that successfully resolve the broad-line regions of 3C 273 and open a new era of active galactic. Reverberation mapping as a powerful tool to investigate inner structure of AGNs will finally complementarily combine with GRAVITY for simultaneous determinations of black hole mass and cosmological distances. This provides a new way of measuring cosmological expansion history of Universe Expansion, which is fully independent of extinction correction and calibrations of cosmic ladders.
