 Title:	 Reverberation mapping of AGNs: roles in the interferometer era
 Speaker:	 Prof. Jianmin Wang (IHEP)
 Location:
蒙民伟科技南楼S727



ABSTRACT

It is the GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer that successfully resolve the broad-line regions of 3C 273 and open a new era of active galactic. Reverberation mapping as a powerful tool to investigate inner structure of AGNs will finally complementarily combine with GRAVITY for simultaneous determinations of black hole mass and cosmological distances. This provides a new way of measuring cosmological expansion history of Universe Expansion, which is fully independent of extinction correction and calibrations of cosmic ladders.

BIO
Graduated from National University of Defense Technology, and obtained PhD from USTC in 1995. Astrophysics professor in IHEP works on supermassive black holes, quasars and cosmology.

========================================================
Intro of RM - Reverberation Mapping
SMBH mass
delay response = reverberation --> distance of the ionized gas to the SMBH
type I AGN - reverberation is the unique method to measure SMBH mass, and the ionized gas around SMBH

distance and delay --> SMBH mass

uncertainty -- 100-200%
--> still get lots concepts
e.g. coevolution

Quasars

RM compaigns: 100 AGNs
DES will detect 100 million AGNs
100 VS 100 million

among the 100 AGNs which have done RM:
chinese -- 50/100 AGNs 

BLR scaling law: R-L relation

Widely applied to:
	SMBH mass
	accration physics
	evolution
	coevolution (SMBH and galaxies)

Observation and theory
Three basic assumptions
	Ionizing sources (isotropic - mass, point souece-accration rate, SED-spin)
	SMBH: single (may be wrong at some systems)
	Ionized gas: homogeneous


Difficulties

Breakthrough in 2018
Spatially resolved rotation of the broad-line region of a quasar at sub-parsec scale

Reverberation - linear size

Spectro Astronomy

Gravity () - angular size

--->combine -- we can get the distance

distance is even more important than mass

pure geometrical measurement

Cutting edge sciences
	Precision SMBH mass
	Coevolution
	SMBH candles, H_0 and expansion history
	close-binary, nano-Hz GWs

Cosmology - high vs low-z universe

SpectroAstronomy + RM = SARM (complementary)
GRAVITY+2m telescope

SARM Analysis: Mass and distances

H_0, \pm 15%
indipemdant of calibration

SMBH binaries and low-f GWs: a new window

Spin evolution: fueling BHs

从观测数据寻找双黑洞系统


高红移的 Quasar， 1+z 延迟，
z = 2时，若延迟为半年，就变为了 1.5 年， 就要观测 ~ 5年
这时候可以每 20 天采一次样

对于低红移， 几天就要采一次样
