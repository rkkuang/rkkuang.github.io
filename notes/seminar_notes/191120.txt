ABSTRACT

I will briefly introduce an X-ray view of the black hole accretion process, and show the similarity between the solar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries and the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. The X-ray emission from the innermost regions of black hole accretion shows violent variability, which is related to a highly variable compact coronal region in the centre. The reprocessing spectrum from the accretion disc (“reflection” spectrum) changes accordingly. The narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 13224-3809 will be given as an example as its X-ray emission shows fast flux peaks on a time scale of kiloseconds, registering at about 100 times the minimum flux seen during the 1.5 Ms XMM-Newton and NuSTAR legacy campaign.
