	We want to know: mass, spin, size, internal structure fi any, interaction with SM particles other then gravity, self interaction
	We know almost nothing about DM except for:
		Equation of state
		total energy density

			about 5 times fo the energy density of baryons
		Its velocity around the earth

 Title:	 Searching for particle nature of dark matter
 Speaker:	 Haipeng An (THU)
 Location:	
Online via Zoom

ABSTRACT

From rotation curves to the large scale structure, the evidences of the existence of dark matter appear in various scale of our universe. But its particle physics natures are still mysterious to us. People have been approaching the particle natures of dark matter using various methods. In this talk I will review the recent development of direct detections, indirect detections and collider searches of dark matter.


BIO

Haipeng An got his Ph.D. from University of Maryland in 2011. Then he moved to the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics from 2011 to 2014. Then he worked at Caltech as a Walter Burke Fellow from 2014 to 2017. He joined Tsinghua University in 2017. His research mainly focuses on particle phenomenology and cosmology. His best known work is the first correct calculation of the solar production rate of light dark photon (a hypocritical vector particle mixes with photon through kinetic mixing).
